# Decisions

This document records important architectural decisions.

## 2026-10-03 — Phase 2 authentication implementation

Implements the existing authentication architecture without adding models or
changing scheduling/financial rules:

- Retain the existing eight-hour HS256 JWT lifetime. Store tokens in a host-only
  HttpOnly cookie scoped to `/api`; production uses Secure. Default SameSite is
  Lax, with explicit configuration for deployment topology.
- Require explicit HTTPS trusted origins in production. Development defaults
  allow only the two local Vite origins. Reject unsafe requests without a trusted
  Origin or, only when Origin is absent, a validated trusted Referer.
- Use bcrypt cost 12. New passwords require 12 characters and at most 72 UTF-8
  bytes; login still accepts existing shorter passwords without changing them.
- Normalize account emails to lowercase in application writes and login.
- Recheck active status and current database role on protected requests. Do not
  add refresh tokens, persistent sessions, or a token revocation model. Logout
  clears the browser cookie; password changes do not revoke issued tokens.
- Use same-origin frontend `/api` requests, with Vite proxying in development and
  a documented HTTPS reverse proxy for deployment.
- Audit Admin account changes in the same transaction, without storing password
  material. Deactivate accounts instead of deleting historical references.

## 2026-10-03 — Phase 3 configuration and reservation protection

- Use the shared transaction advisory-lock key `739021` for salon coordination.
  Salon-wide configuration writes take it exclusively; staff-specific writes take
  it shared, then lock affected Staff rows in sorted UUID order. Future reservation
  writers must use this same coordination key and ordered Staff-lock protocol.
- Recheck the acting Admin under a User row share lock inside each write transaction.
  Validate affected ACTIVE service reservations on CONFIRMED appointments and live
  PENDING_PAYMENT holds using fresh post-lock database time and the full reserved
  interval, including buffers. Reject and roll back both mutation and audit on conflict.
- Interpret weekly schedules with `SALON_TIMEZONE` (default `Asia/Manila`) and
  Temporal local-date arithmetic. Union adjacent/overlapping schedule windows.
  This supplies configuration validation; availability/assignment remains Phase 4.
- Force UTC PostgreSQL sessions in the shared application/seed pool factory.
  The installed Prisma pg adapter's timestamp conversion otherwise depends on
  session timezone. Read the fresh clock as numeric epoch milliseconds to avoid
  raw timestamptz conversion errors. Preserve existing historical data unchanged.
- Policies are create-only versions, numbered under exclusive salon coordination.
  Null effective time activates at fresh database time; explicit times must be
  prospective. Activation follows `effectiveFrom`, with no new model or flag.
- Services, staff, qualifications, hours, and schedules use active-state changes.
  Unreferenced closure/unavailability periods may be removed with their prior
  values retained in the transaction's audit record. Schedule/absence staff and
  qualification staff/service identities are immutable on edit.
- Config API updates use full replacement PUT payloads with strict validation.
  Public reads omit internal reasons, commission rates, user identities, and audits.


## 2026-10-03 — Phase 4 advisory availability

- Add a read-only POST availability search for ordered service/staff selections,
  plus a public qualified-staff catalog and `/availability` customer page. No new
  entities, migrations, holds, customer records, or appointment writes.
- For the small-salon MVP, advisory searches use shared salon coordination and
  acquire all existing Staff locks in ascending order, then reload active inputs
  and evaluate fresh database time. This favors coherent results over maximum
  read concurrency. Booking must still perform its own Phase 5 locking/revalidation.
- Validate the complete sequence before resolving assignments. Every interval is
  fixed by duration plus buffer independently of staff choice, and intervals are
  sequential/nonoverlapping. Nonempty per-service candidate sets therefore prove
  complete-plan feasibility without exponential backtracking. Rank candidates by
  existing target-date pending/confirmed workload, then staff ID ascending.
- Clip workload to the salon-local day. Completed reservations block overlaps until
  their original reserved end but are excluded from the specified workload metric.
  Pending-payment holds remain active at deadline equality, and expire logically
  after it even before cleanup.
- Interpret advance-booking days as salon-local calendar days, consistent with
  salon-local policy interpretation; lead minutes, service durations, and buffers
  use elapsed minutes. Cache converted weekly windows within each search.
- The advisory request accepts 1–20 ordered selections and one date. Enumerate
  starts at one-minute cadence and allow optional exact `startAt` checks so the
  presentation cadence does not become a new reservation rule. Disable response
  caching and clear client results after inputs change.

## 2026-10-03 — Phase 5 booking, holds, and private guest access

- Reuse the Phase 4 planning engine and a shared data loader inside the booking
  transaction. AppointmentService rows remain the reservation authority; no
  schema or migration change is required.
- Retain small-salon coordination: SHARED salon lock, all existing Staff rows in
  ascending ID order, then transaction-specific Appointment locks for expiration.
  Detect newly discovered staff and restart instead of extending a held lock set
  out of order. Limit transaction restarts to three attempts.
- Select the effective fixed-fee policy after locks using database wall-clock time.
  Recheck immediately before mutation and before completion. A policy activation
  during the transaction rolls back all snapshots/customer/audit writes and retries;
  crossed booking/hold deadlines fail without partial records. Hold expiration that
  changes deterministic assignment during a wait also causes a complete retry.
- Issue an independent 96-bit random booking reference and 256-bit guest token.
  Store only the token's SHA-256 hash. Token-authenticated retrieval uses POST JSON
  with trusted browser origins and uncached responses; a code alone grants no access.
  Private UI links use fragments, removed from the current history entry on load;
  the frontend stores credentials in component memory, not browser storage.
- Keep hold cleanup in a separate process, polling bounded batches using the
  database clock. Reload status and deadline after the shared coordination,
  ordered Staff locks, and Appointment lock. Expiration preserves historical rows
  and audits its status transition exactly once. Logical expiration remains
  independent of worker availability.
- Use the existing notification vocabulary as specified: there is no event for
  unpaid hold creation or expiration. Those transitions write audit records only.
  BOOKING_CONFIRMED/PAYMENT_RECEIVED must be enqueued atomically by Phase 6 after
  verified payment; never send a confirmation notification for a temporary hold.

## 2026-10-03 — Phase 6 appointment-fee processing

- Use the existing Payment, Receipt, AuditLog, and NotificationQueue entities.
  The PaymentProvider boundary creates attempts and authenticates captured results
  outside reservation transactions. No provider call holds a database lock.
- Default online payment to disabled. The explicit development/test adapter uses
  raw-body HMAC verification and a clearly labeled guest simulator. Both environment
  parsing and adapter construction reject test payments in production.
- Follow ARCHITECTURE Section 23's authorized Admin/Cashier manual workflow.
  Manual recording requires the original collection reference and the exact
  snapshotted fee in PHP. It records received funds rather than initiating payment.
- Serialize confirmation against expiration with shared salon coordination,
  sorted Staff locks, and Appointment/Payment locks. Refresh the database clock
  after waits and before finalization; restart if a later write crosses the hold
  deadline. Never use a provider timestamp to restore released reservations.
- Match payment identity, provider reference, appointment, amount, currency, and
  captured status. Preserve separate captures with reconciliation REQUIRED while
  only one successful payment satisfies the booking obligation. Duplicate event
  delivery produces no new receipt, audit transition, or outbox event.
- Issue manual-payment receipts atomically with the capture. Provider receipts
  are issued idempotently by an authenticated Admin/Cashier later, because the
  existing Receipt requires issuedByUserId. No fabricated system user or schema
  change is introduced. Snapshots use decimal strings and immutable issued data.
- Enqueue PAYMENT_RECEIVED for each distinct capture, and BOOKING_CONFIRMED only
  for a successful timely confirmation. Prefer the customer's email when supplied,
  otherwise SMS. Delivery is Phase 9. No guest credentials enter queue payloads.
- Provide bounded Admin reconciliation browsing and authorized receipt issuance;
  no refund execution or post-finalization financial corrections are introduced.
- GCash merchant access was reported available. The gateway was subsequently
  identified as PayMongo on 2026-10-04; see the integration decision below.

## 2026-10-04 — PayMongo GCash Hosted Checkout

- Integrate PayMongo Hosted Checkout V2 with GCash only, using server-side Basic
  authentication and exact integer centavos. No fee pass-through or business-rule
  changes. API calls use fixed official HTTPS endpoints, bounded timeouts, and
  redacted errors. Accept checkout navigation only on checkout.paymongo.com.
- Keep the private guest page open and launch checkout through a separate-tab link.
  Return to the configured trusted frontend /appointment URL without guest tokens.
  A return redirect never confirms payment. Token-authenticated status checks can
  retrieve merchant-side capture state through the same confirmation service.
- Verify raw-body Paymongo-Signature HMAC using the configured test/live mode and
  a five-minute timestamp tolerance. Retrieve the merchant session server-to-server
  before accepting paid capture details. Store captured pay_ identity in the unique
  externalReference and session identity/creation state in existing Payment metadata.
- Do not assume undocumented provider create idempotency. Persist a creation claim
  before the network call, reuse known pending sessions, and refuse blind repeated
  creation after uncertain responses. Signed events can recover a lost response;
  Admin recovery verifies the merchant session and its internal association and is
  audited. No new model or migration is required.
- Do not assume an undocumented configurable checkout expiry field. After releasing
  expired holds, the worker retrieves and expires one provider session per cycle,
  outside DB locks. Failed/in-progress expiration is retried; late captures remain
  successful financial records requiring reconciliation.
- Enforce test PayMongo keys outside production and live keys in production. Online
  payment remains disabled by default. Merchant sandbox and live acceptance are
  external verification dependencies, not claims made by mocked adapter tests.


## 2026-10-04 — Phase 7 appointment changes and no-show recovery

- The user reported Phase 6 testing complete and explicitly authorized Phase 7,
  with payment-error analysis deferred to future follow-up. This records user
  acceptance; it does not fabricate independently observed merchant evidence.
- Reuse existing entities and the shared salon/all-Staff/Appointment lock protocol.
  Recovery also locks source Payment rows before fresh time/credit evaluation.
  Rescheduling and recovery retain the original governing policy and repeat
  time-sensitive eligibility and planning checks before committing.
- Identify retained service occurrences by AppointmentService ID, supporting
  repeated instances of the same service with different historical snapshots.
  Reuse the availability engine with per-occurrence name/duration/buffer overrides.
  Added occurrences must be active even when the same inactive service is retained.
- Temporarily mark current service rows REMOVED inside the transaction to permit
  arbitrary sequence changes under the existing partial unique index. Reactivate
  retained rows without repricing or changing their commission snapshot; permanently
  removed rows keep their previous schedule/outcome and removal time. Write lossless
  versioned before/after history with explicit fields and no guest credentials.
- No-show marking is Admin-only, once the appointment start has arrived and before
  service outcomes are recorded. Grace is calculated from the missed start. Retrying
  cancellation/no-show marking is idempotent; ordinary changes consume the existing
  reschedule allowance and recovery uniqueness is enforced under locks and by the DB.
- A successful, unrefunded, unused original appointment-fee obligation in PHP that
  satisfies the governing amount can be carried once. Reference that Payment from
  the replacement; never create a second collection. Otherwise create a normal hold.
  Recovery issues independent guest credentials and preserves the original NO_SHOW
  appointment. Recovery history belongs to the original and identifies the replacement.
- Audit and applicable notification records commit with each change. No-show marking
  has no approved notification event; recovery queues its event plus confirmation
  only when credit confirms it. Provider calls and delivery stay outside this phase.

## 2026-10-04 — Phase 8 settlement and deferred acceptance

- The user authorized Phase 8 and asked to retain manual browser acceptance and
  similar review items for correction after implementing the remaining phases.
  `ACCEPTANCE_BACKLOG.md` tracks that work; deferred checks are never reported as
  passed. This instruction does not automatically authorize Phase 9 implementation.
- Reuse existing AppointmentService, Payment, Receipt and CommissionRecord models.
  Settlement uses shared salon coordination, ordered Staff locks, then Appointment
  serialization, matching appointment-change workflows. No migrations are needed.
- Cashiers initially record outcomes; Admins correct already recorded outcomes.
  Only Cashiers finalize service payment or no-service closure. Live account/role
  validation occurs inside each transaction as well as at the HTTP boundary.
- The outcome screen uses the stored priceSnapshot as actualChargedAmount for
  PERFORMED and zero for NOT_PERFORMED. No discretionary price-editing or discount
  workflow is introduced. Historical commission rates remain unchanged.
- Require the complete active-service set and a revision of the reviewed appointment
  and outcomes. Concurrent corrections invalidate a Cashier's prior review, even
  when the resulting total is unchanged. Finalization timestamps are set only when
  payment/closure commits; completed outcomes cannot be edited.
- Manual service payments use stable idempotency keys and original collection
  references in the existing manual-provider namespace. Matching retries return the
  original result; conflicting identities and second collections are rejected.
- Allocate only successful, unrefunded PHP appointment-fee obligations, including
  explicitly carried source payments. Reconciliation captures are excluded. Decimal
  proportional allocation, deterministic remainder assignment, and ROUND_HALF_UP
  commissions commit with the full service charge, immutable itemized receipt,
  completion, audits, and notification outbox. Appointment fees are not deducted
  from the service charge or collected again.
- All-NOT_PERFORMED closure is idempotent and generates only operational completion,
  finalized outcomes, audit, and completion outbox records. No-service closure never
  creates a service payment, receipt, fee allocation, or commission.

## Phase 9 — Independent notification delivery (2026-10-04)

- Reuse NotificationQueue without schema changes. Atomically claim one due row using
  PostgreSQL `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, the database clock, updatedAt lease time, and
  attemptCount generation. Recover expired leases; exhaust bounded attempts even
  when every attempt crashes. Conditional completion/failure rejects stale generations.
- Providers execute outside transactions and never mutate bookings or payments.
  Timeouts abort transport; bounded exponential retries persist controlled error
  codes without provider bodies or contact data. SENT means acceptance by the provider.
- Add independently selectable email/SMS boundaries, non-production test delivery,
  optional Resend email and Twilio Messaging Service SMS adapters. The user has no
  selected accounts yet; both channels default disabled and retain unattempted work.
  Credentials, domain/sender registration, and live acceptance remain deployment tasks.
- Use queue ID for Resend idempotency (provider window: 24 hours). Twilio has no
  assumed send idempotency. Crash-after-acceptance delivery remains at least once.
- Default reminder window is 24 hours, configurable from 0 (off) to 168. Queue only
  future CONFIRMED appointments; deduplicate by appointment/startAt/rescheduleCount
  under the appointment row lock, including previously SENT/FAILED reminders.
  Recheck current schedule before send; obsolete reminders end FAILED with a specific
  code because the existing enum has no suppressed/cancelled state. External delivery
  cannot be recalled if an appointment changes after that pre-send check.
- Preserve existing email-otherwise-SMS selection. Normalize Philippine local mobile
  numbers only at delivery; do not rewrite historical contacts. Plain-text templates
  distinguish pending recovery, reconciliation payments, and no-service closure.
  Never reconstruct guest tokens or include private credentials in a message.

## Phase 10 — Reports and customer assistance (2026-10-04)

- Reports read existing historical records; no accounting, chat-history, or other
  entities/migrations are added. Report services enforce current user access and use
  repeatable-read transactions for internally consistent summaries and pagination.
- Admin receives appointment, payment-attempt, receipt, commission, audit and dashboard
  reads. Cashier receives aggregate collection summaries only; no commission, audit,
  or general report access. Audit output recursively omits credential fields and
  provider metadata. Private guest-token hashes never enter appointment reports.
- Date filters are inclusive salon-local calendar dates, converted to half-open UTC
  intervals, at most 366 days. Each report labels its date basis: scheduled start,
  payment-attempt creation, receipt issuance, commission finalization, or audit creation.
- Collections aggregate Payment once, without joining carried credits or one-to-many
  relations. Captures include SUCCEEDED and REFUNDED rows by paidAt; refunds use
  refundedAt. Net cash movement is captures less period refunds, not profit/revenue.
  Successful applied/unapplied and reconciliation-required amounts describe current
  status of captures in the period; reconciliation is a subset, never added again.
  Amounts remain Decimal until formatted, grouped by currency. Current payment status
  is not an as-of historical ledger. No refund workflow is introduced.
- Customer assistance initially uses a deterministic guided conversation, current
  public configuration services and fixed policy explanations. It routes customers
  to authoritative availability and guest-management screens, makes no mutations,
  and stores no chat history. The UI identifies this as a guided assistant. An external
  AI provider remains an optional choice discussed with the user, not configured or
  required for this implementation. No provider costs or credentials are introduced.

## 2026-10-05 — Phase 11 local release preparation

- User authorized Phase 11 and selected local preparation because no hosting target
  is selected. Live deployment and provider/salon acceptance remain pending.
- Provide an adaptable single-server Linux baseline: Caddy serves built frontend
  assets and same-origin API; systemd supervises the API and two existing workers.
  This adds no distributed infrastructure or new persistence models.
- First production Admin is created through a local operator command on an empty
  User table, using existing account validation, bcrypt and transactional SYSTEM
  audit. Production development seeding remains forbidden.
- Readiness and liveness are separate; readiness safely checks DB/User-table access.
  Default API binding is loopback, configurable through validated HOST.
- Backup restoration targets an explicitly named empty database, verifies the archive
  checksum, preserves transactions and refuses destructive replacement. Recovery
  requires payment/message reconciliation before re-enabling providers.
- Acceptance fixes receipt wrapping/print isolation and same-tab private-link
  navigation. Scheduling, payment and historical-data rules are unchanged.
